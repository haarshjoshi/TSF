## Project at The Sparks Foundation
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Supervised Machine Learning on datasets provided by TSF. 
### Objectives
The objective were to: 
* find out areas in order to increase profits in stores using EDA.
* predict the scores of students who study for a particular number of hours based on the data provided.
### Language used
 2 Jupyter notebooks which utilize **python** are used to carry out the tasks. The files are named:
 * Exploratory Data Analysis-Retail.ipynb: This file contains the EDA for reatil data
 * Task 1- SUPERVISED LEARNING.IPYNB: This file contains the code for supervised leaning task.
### Libraries Utilised
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
